Analysing outliers outliers using boxplot:

Create boxplots using the values for distance between data points and the best fit line (y = âˆšc^2 - x^2)
Analyse the outlier states (points farthest from the best fit line) to identify other important determinants of food insecurity in that state
Investigate why some variables deviate from the trend line in some states
Suggest better targeted and prepared policies for such states
