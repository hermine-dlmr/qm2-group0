Since no annual nor local data on 2020 food insecurity exists, yet, the only data we found was from the Household Pulse Survey by the US Census Bureau. 
This survey provided us with 20 weekly tables. 
We chose to analyse April 2020  - when the economic recession started. 
We filtered through to calculate national and local state values for food insecurity. 
However, the agency did not provide any guidance on how food insecurity had been defined in those tables, which made it difficult to understand and use the data. 
Therefore, we followed the definition of food insecurity given by the USDA when using values from certain categories on the Household Pulse Survey's data tables.
