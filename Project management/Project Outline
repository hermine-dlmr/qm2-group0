Project Outline/Overview:

Abstract + background - say what our topic is about, define food insecurity, in one or two sentences why it’s relevant
    - map for food insecurity + histogram (in introduction/literature review)
    
Aims & objectives - 1 or 2 main aims + more objectives
 Aims: 
  To understand the main determinants of food insecurity in the US
  Outliers: To see whether there are exceptions within some states (this will show us how significant each variable is)
  How has COVID affected food insecurity 
Objectives:


Literature review - use articles to contextualise research + justify our research
Intro to methodologies 
    - Mention that we used either % of COVID cases per state or COVID cases per 100,000 (taking population density into account)

Part 1 - what are the causes of food insecurity + analysing interesting case studies
  Scatter plots - income, unemployment, race
  Statsitical analysis per graph - describe function, p value /r correlation, range for food insecurity!!
  Contextual graph per graph - income + unemployment graphs - noting 2 or 3 interesting case studies - maryland - highest income not the lowest food insecurity
  Ethnic groups graph - limitations, past research has already shown the correlation

  Overall sentence: concluding the correlations found 

Part 2 - COVID
  Using income and unemployment to explain racial disparities
  1 timeline with lines 3 showing rates of FI, unemployment and income
  Bar charts for income and unemployment with race on the x-axis
  Bubble chart for unemployment vs FI (w/ COVID cases)
	  - Contextualising: Case study
  Contextualising: What could be reasons for increased levels of FI & unemployment among different racial groups (Asians → hatred because of Covid; Black people → jobs mainly in service sector etc.)
  Race → more significant correlation when the sample includes just households that self-reported as FI (Morales)

  Introduction - Income vs food insecurity bubble chart - shows the added level of COVID 
  Timeline graph for unemployment + timeline graph for food insecurity (FINDING DATA)
  Bar chart showing unemployment across ethnic groups + how much it’s increased
  Contextual Analysis showing correlation between unemployment and food insecurity shown in part 1 and now correlation between COVID and increase of unemployment 
  Linking all the variables in how they increase food insecurity 

Part 3
  4 way SNAP graph - 
  Contextual analysis Political problem, where SNAP participation needs to increase
  Concluding thoughts on policy making + future improvements involving COVID 

Conclusion
