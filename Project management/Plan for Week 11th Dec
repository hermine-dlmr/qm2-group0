Structure of the Website:
Literature Review - why our topic/issue matters, drawing on previous research, mention ethics

Aim - endpoint
Objectives - means to meeting our aims
(Check the document hermine shared from IRM to see the structure of a literature review)

Sections of our Website:
Scatter plots of variables causing food insecurity- data analysis + putting it back into context (analysing specific outliers/states worth noting like for the excel graphs made for the presentation)
No boxplots - wouldn’t work for linking 2 variables

Policies - SNAP participation 4 way graph - data analysis + putting it back into context

COVID - 19 - map of COVID-19 cases, scatter plots for unemployment vs COVID (linking increase rate of unemployment to increase rate of food insecurity)

Things to be decided:
Which variables for scatter plots in part 1? - unemployment, income, race?
COVID-19 - could alternative graphs be made?

Dividing up the workload:
Ella - Making scatter plots for part 1 
Zeynep and Ella - writing up the literature review and putting graphs back into context
Hermine - Map for COVID or food insecurity (TBD)
Milli and Josephine - data analysis of the data visualizations 
TBD who does the - SNAP 4 way graph, data visualizations for COVID 

(Disclaimer: these roles aren’t set in stone if anyone wants to change anything - I just wrote them down as a general idea) 

For next week:
Ella - make scatter plot for unemployment - look into the context of the outliers of the scatter plots for part 1 
Hermine - week 9/10 workbooks for maps
Zeynep - starting to format literature review?
Milli - deeper analysis on covid to check what visualizations can be used?
Josephine - looking into how we could code the 4 way graph?
