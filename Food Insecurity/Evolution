This timeline graph shows how food insecurity rates have evolved in the US over the past 21 years - from 1998 to 2019. 
The jump from 2007 to 2008 rates is due to the Great Recession which took place between December 2007 and June 2009. 
After reaching an all-time high in 2009, food insecurity rates have been declining over the past decade. 
However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has significantly reversed these improvements. 
The added effect of the current pandemic and its resulting food insecurity rate of 2020 are investigated here.
