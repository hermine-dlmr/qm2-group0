These two choropleth maps show how levels of food insecurity have increased from 2019 to 2020 among American states. 
We can see from the legends of each graph that food insecurity rates in 2019 and 2020 have different ranges and maximum and minimum values. 
The table below shows these values and the percent increase going from 2019 into 2020.

The interactive maps are designed to give precise food insecurity values for each state, and it is important not to be misguided by the colours when comparing them.  
Notably, they have different scales because the range of-, maximum- and minimum values of food insecurity differ in 2019 and 2020. 
For example, in the 2020 map, South Dakota is coloured a very light red, whereas, in the 2019 map, it is coloured a darker shade. 
However, since these are relative values, this does not mean that the 2019 food insecurity rate for South Dakota was higher than the 2020 rate. 
In fact, the food insecurity rate was 16.1% in 2020 and 10.9% in 2019.
