Our main motivation with this project is to understand the issue of food insecurity in the US by breaking it down to three parts. 
Our goal is to first analyse the main determinants of food insecurity in the US and see how important of a role they play by paying attention to outlier states. 
Secondly, we aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity. 
Lastly, we intend to assess the effectiveness of SNAP and explore whether/how it might be related to the political affiliation of different states.
