Evolution of food insecurity over the years until 2020 with Covid-19 projections (add the projected unemployment/poverty % increase and create visualisation)


Brainstorming ideas:

Map the meal gap study uses these determinants to show their relationship with food insecurity:
non-undergraduate student poverty
unemployment
median income
homeownership					
disability status 
Since Covid-19 has affected unemployment, hence income levels and certain social groups have been hard-hit, we can add some new variables that we’ve found to be closely correlated to food insecurity in our background research/literature review to this equation:
household structure (single-parent)
ethnicity
demographic of agricultural workers ?
distribution of food to states ?
Create visualisations with Covid-19 food insecurity projections
Critique current food policies according to findings
