To pursue our research and to fully grasp our topic, we have decided to use different methods.

To create the various types of visualisations, we searched for online dataset for the 50-US states. 

For each state, we have decided to focus on different parameters: 
the level of food insecurity, the level of income, the level of umemployment, the number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 to understand how each variable influences the level of food insecuerity in each state. 

To achieve the aims of our first part, we have plotted scatter plots for each parameter VS the level of food insecurity for each state. For each graph, we have decided to conduct statistical and contextual analysis to place the visualisations back into the context of the project.

In the second part, we have decided to add the covid-19 variable and 


We have also produced a bubble chart
