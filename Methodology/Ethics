Ethics 

There exist issues with the data from the Census Bureau such as exclusions. Is this data 100% reliable? This should be considered when we created the graphs – accuracy is arguable.

It seems that anonymity was preserved over the data we worked with – no ability to identify an individual in particular from the data. 

We have not been directly confronted with ethical issues since we did not conduct questionnaires or interview experts on our topic. However, if it had been the case, we would have had to follow some strict ethical rules such as voluntary consent, subject can withdraw at any time, consent to share the data produced and preserve anonymity.
