Potential improvements

Highlighting correlations, we will be able to target where exactly improvements can be made. 
For example, if our analysis reveals that food insecurity is more likely in states providing an improved health care system, we will make food insecurity a health care issue. This correlation will reveal that states suffering the most from food insecurity are more likely to provide a weak health care system.
Therefore, we will be able to confirm that states should enhance health care systems to fight food insecurity better, and we will suggest to reformulate the Obama Care to tackle the issue.
Of course, these correlations are applicable to other variables than health care, such as income, unemployment, political orientation, agricultural production, household structure, food waste, etc.
