Plan/ Datasets

1. Plan

understand food insecurity across the whole US, by studying different variables that we believe are in direct correlation to the level of food insecurity
These include: median household income, unemployment rate, agricultural production of a state, household structure (example single households, families with children), and the overall food waste
analyse each state, by taking named variables into account and finding the correlations level of food insecurity

analyse outliers
e.g.:  states with relatively low food insecurity but very low median household income which would normally contribute to a high level of food insecurity

examine how variables are related to different demographic groups
e.g.: how the unemployment rate changes for different ethnic groups & how this contributes to them being more or less affected by food insecurity

temporal analysis, looking at the current pandemic. We will determine which states are most affected by COVID-19/ analyse how the number of cases correlates to food insecurity in these states. We will look at how covid-19 has impacted our variables so for example income and unemployment/ food chain/ etc.

2. Techniques to be used

In order to successfully carry out all of these ideas, we will:

-	Use graphs and geographic maps to show the level of food insecurity in each state
-	Scatterplots to find the correlation between variables and food insecurity
-	Then use boxplots to show the outliers of the scatterplot correlations
-	For our temporal analysis our visualisation will be a bubble chart that will be explained later in the presentation as well

3. Datasets 

Here are some examples of data sets we will use, mainly focus on government statistics of the united states but for our covid-19 analysis we will look for example at statistics from the John Hopkins University
