Plan/ Datasets

1. Plan

understand food insecurity across the whole US: examine different variables that we believe are in direct correlation to the levels of food insecurity
These include: median household income, unemployment rate, agricultural production of a state, household structure (example single households, families with children), and the overall food waste

analyse outliers
e.g.:  states with relatively low food insecurity but very low median household income which would normally contribute to a high level of food insecurity

examine how levels of food insecurity (variables) are related to different demographic groups
e.g.: how the unemployment rate changes for different ethnic groups & how this contributes to them being more or less affected by food insecurity

temporal analysis: looking at the current pandemic. We will determine which states are most affected by COVID-19/ analyse how the number of cases correlates to food insecurity in these states. 
We will look at how covid-19 has impacted our variables: e.g. income and unemployment/ food chain/ etc.

2. Techniques to be used

In order to successfully carry out all of these ideas, we will:

-	Use graphs and geographic maps to show the level of food insecurity in each state
-	Scatterplots to find the correlation between variables and food insecurity
-	Then use boxplots to show the outliers of the scatterplot correlations
-	For our temporal analysis our visualisation will be a bubble chart that will be explained later in the presentation as well

3. Datasets 

Here are some examples of data sets we will use, mainly focus on government statistics of the united states but for our covid-19 analysis we will look for example at statistics from the John Hopkins University 

Map the Meal Gap - Feeding America 
Household Food Insecurity Rates by State - United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Median household income in the U.S by state 2019 - US Census Bureau
Rate of U.S. coronavirus (COVID-19) cases as of November 11, 2020, by state - CNN; Johns Hopkins University
State unemployment rate in the U.S. 2019 - Bureau of Labor Statistics
The Impact of Coronavirus on Food Insecurity 2020 (projections data)- Feeding America
Map the Meal Gap 2011-2020 (2009-2018 data) - Feeding America
