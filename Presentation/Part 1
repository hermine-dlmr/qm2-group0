Introduction / Literature review


Hi everyone, 
 
We have decided in our group to focus our analysis on food insecurity in the US and the impact of covid-19 on food insecurity.


•	Food insecurity, in this context, precisely refers to not leading “an active life” because the food consumed can be low quality or not in a sufficient quantity provoking obesity or hunger. 

•	In other words, food insecurity is a wide topic with various subsets such as obesity, hunger, malnutrition, etc.

•	One key feature of food insecurity is having to make trade-offs (between food quality and electricity for instance) 


Since the US is a developed country, food insecurity is an often overlooked topic next to issue like hunger in African countries. And although the severity of the topic is relatively less, it does not negate the fact that it exists and affects millions of households. In fact, people tend to underestimate the actual weight of food insecurity in the US society 

In fact, the USDA reported that in 2019 “more than 35 million people lived in a food insecure household” and over 30% of that figure (which is equivalent to appx.11 million) are children.

These are actually the lowest recorded rates of food insecurity in the US in more than 20 years, however, Feeding America predicts an increase in these rates due to Covid-19 in 2020, which we are going to be investigating in this project.


As you can see here, the graph shows the percentage of individuals who are food insecure by state. The point of this graph is to provide a general visualisation of the states more affected by food insecurity and the ones less affected by it. 
- North Dakota : lower rate 
- Mississippi : higher rate (slightly below 30%)
Introduction / General knowledge before actually having a deeper look at the impact of covid-19 on food insecurity in the US.
