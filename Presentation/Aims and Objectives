Aims and Objectives:
Shed light to food insecurity in the US

Questions we want to answer: 

What are the causes of food insecurity?
What are the main variables that define food insecurity in the US?
 
Which demographic groups are affected by food insecurity?

How has COVID-19 affected levels of food insecurity for each state?
How has Covid-19 affected unemployment, income levels and agricultural production & food distribution in the US?
Which groups were affected the most?

Our goal is to find more specific policies to help marginalised groups and to shed light on the added burden of COVID-19.
