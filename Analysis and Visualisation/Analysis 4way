An important amount of Democrat States appears in the top-left hand corner, embodying "above-average SNAPs" and "below-average Food Insecurity".  In addition, a large majority of Democrat states is above the US SNAPs average, implying that the US Democratic political party efficiently helps food-insecure households.

To the contrary, the large majority of Republican States is below the US SNAP average, implying that Republican states are less likely than their Democrat peers to provide aids to food-insecure households.

​

More broadly, the graph showcases that highly food-insecure states are not necessarily the ones that do badly in providing aids. Michigan (D), for example, is above the US Food Insecurity average, yet among the states providing the most aids proportionately to its population. To the contrary, Wyoming (R) is below the US Food Insecurity average, yet its percentage of SNAPs compared to the percentage of food-insecure households is among the lowest in the US.

​

Overall, the fact that Democrat states provide more SNAPs shows that overcoming Food Insecurity is possible, at least partially. Governments have the power and the means to overcome Food Insecurity, they are therefore responsible for it.
