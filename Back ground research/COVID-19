Analysing the effects of COVID-19 on food insecurity is highly relevant. 
One idea is to plot the variable with the greatest correlation against food insecurity as a bubble graph with the bubbles representing the number of COVID-19 transmissions.
This will show that, for example, states with a currently low level of food insecurity but with a large number of COVID-19 transmissions, may suffer more in the future.
Could be interesting to plot a graph of the proportion of service sector per state seeing as this is the sector that's worst hit by COVID-19
