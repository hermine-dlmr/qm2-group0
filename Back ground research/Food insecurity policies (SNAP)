SNAP provides nutrition assistance benefits to low income individuals/families, it’s the largest food assistance program administered by The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).
SNAP targets the households most in need by providing them with additional benefits. 
To account for rising food prices, the the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act raised the maximum SNAP benefit by 13.6%, from April 2009. 
Difficulty of using household survey data when estimating effect of SNAP on food insecurity; 
“households that participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not (selection bias). For example, households that...have lower levels of food security are more likely to participate in SNAP. 
Therefore, initial differences in food insecurity between participants and nonparticipants may be greater than the ameliorative effects of the program”
