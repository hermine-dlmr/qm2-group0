SNAP provides nutrition assistance benefits to low income individuals/families, it’s the largest food assistance program administered by The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).
SNAP targets the households most in need by providing them with additional benefits. 
To account for rising food prices, the the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act raised the maximum SNAP benefit by 13.6%, from April 2009. 
Difficulty of using household survey data when estimating effect of SNAP on food insecurity; 
“households that participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not (selection bias). For example, households that...have lower levels of food security are more likely to participate in SNAP. 
Therefore, initial differences in food insecurity between participants and nonparticipants may be greater than the ameliorative effects of the program”


Study on Urban vs Rural SNAP Participation
https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/SNAPFS_Summary.pdf
Low or high access to food was determined by: 
distance to nearest supermarket, density (no. of shops), potential access (whether local are contained at least 1 supermarket), realized access (travel distance to store). 
Food insecurity levels were found to be similar in urban and rural households:
BUT accoridng to Feeding America: Rural counties accounted for “87% of counties with the highest rates of overall food insecurity” 
LOOK INTO THESE CONTRADICTING STATEMENTS 					
Geographic access to food generally didn’t impact impact food insecurity levels. WHAT ABOUT FOOD DESERTS THOUGH?
The effect of SNAP participation was similar for urban and rural households; 
both groups saw a decrease in food insecurity by about 5 to 10 percentage points after participating for 6 months. 2 CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS?
“For rural households, evidence was mixed as to whether SNAP participation was associated with reduced food insecurity depending on the access measure used.”

Study using adults with income below 200% of the federal poverty threshold to see if SNAP can reduce health care expenditures. 
“Compared with other low-income adults, SNAP participants were younger..., more likely to have public insurance or be uninsured...and more likely to be disabled”

ELIGIBILITY

Eligibility for SNAP - some families fall into the gray zone of being above the poverty line that makes them eligible for SNAP but still have a low enough income that makes them food insecure

Extra - RIghts based approach to food insecurity
Why is food not recognised as a right?
“Food insecurity is more than just a health problem” JUSTIFIES OUR RESEARCH 
The social/political factors of food insecurity often overlooked (poverty, health, lack of schooling). 
Therefore we need to have “an interagency body that can coordinate government efforts across a number of types of interventions.”
Advocates for a human rights framework, which would focus on the more vulnerable groups (due to socioeconomic factors) 
and understand their susceptibility to food insecurity in order to change conditions.
“To implement the right to food means to put the structural processes in place whereby agencies, organizations, and citizens are working toward the common goal of actively respecting, protecting, and promoting the right to food.”
