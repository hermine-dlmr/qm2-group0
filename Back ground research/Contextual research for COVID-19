1) Feeding America – The Impact of the Coronavirus on Food Insecurity in 2020
-	Does calculations on the national level  “unemployment has varied across the country” (pg. 2)
o	Why is our research important?  we will dive deeper and analyse food insecurity state by state rather than nationally
o	Feeding America method:
	projected change in unemployment  unemployment at the local level adjusted using actual rates
	projected change in poverty  poverty at the national level used across all geographies
-	“the most vulnerable members of the society are in positions to fare the worst.”
-	Individuals at “highest risk for serious illnesses associated with Covid-19 – including seniors, people with chronic illnesses, and people of colour – are in many cases, the same individuals who are being most adversely affected by the economic recession that began in the spring of 2020”
-	Potential impact of Covid-19 on FI in 2020
-	Before Covid-19  more than 35 million people lived in a food insecure household 
o	Lowest rate in more than 20 years
o	But, the current pandemic “has reversed improvements made over the past decade since the Great Recession”
o	“Millions of people are newly experiencing food insecurity” (alongside others who were facing FI before the pandemic
-	Map the Meal Gap (MMG) study  FA produced local-level estimates of food insecurity for ten years
-	FA used projected changes in unemployment and poverty  variables that have a statistically significant effect on food insecurity & likely to most directly be affected by Covid-19

Note: should distinguish between “rates of food insecurity” and “number of food insecure people”  higher/lower population areas

Table ideas:
-	Table 1: National projections of food insecurity and underlying factors for 2020 & findings (after covid across all geographies):
o	Places with relatively high rates of FI  continue to have relatively higher rates
o	Relatively high numbers of food-insecure people (higher population areas)  relatively higher numbers
o	Relatively lower rates  larger relative increases in FI (though will generally still have relatively lower rates)
-	Table 2: Areas with the highest 2020 food insecurity projections due to Covid-19
o	State, county, congressional district (overall/children)  should we analyse within states?
o	Could create a similar graph using more variables
-	Figure 1: Projected rates of food insecurity among the overall population in 2020 by state (map)
-	Table 3: States with the 10 highest rates of projected food insecurity in 2020 versus 2018
o	Exceptions: Nevada and Michigan (due to projected increases in unemployment in 2020)
-	Table 4: States with the highest projected percent change in food insecurity rate between 2018 and 2020
o	Only Nevada is on the table 3 list  why did these 4 states have the largest percent change despite still having relatively lower rates of FI?
-	Are we going to look at children?
-	Are we going to look at counties and congressional districts?
-	Food insecurity in Latino communities:
o	“Higher proportion of Latino workers are employed in the leisure and hospitality industry and a lower proportion are employed in roles that can be performed at home”
o	April 2020  unemployment rate among Latinos spiked  18.9% (higher than any other racial/ethnic group)
o	Some of that jobless has since been recovered  but, many communities still face the challenges as “Covid-19 keeps segments of the economy from operating at full capacity”
-	FI in Native American communities:
o	18/28 counties with majority Native American (American Indian or Alaska Native) population  projected to be high FI counties in 2020 (counties with the top 10% of FI rates)
o	Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska (91% identifies as Native American) projected to have the highest CFI rate (56.9%) and the second highest overall FI rate (34.8%) in 2020
	Cause: history of persistent geographic displacement & damaging federal policies  above-average unemployment and poverty
	These disparities  increase vulnerability to Covid
•	Higher rates of high-risk health conditions incl. respiratory diseases
•	More limited access to clean water (challenging to wash hands frequently  poorer health overall)
•	Communal and crowded living situations  barriers to practicing social distancing
-	FI in Black communities:
o	Before the pandemic  black individuals 2.4 times more likely to live in FI households as white individuals (19.2% vs 8.1%)
o	Only 3% of all counties are majority black (>50%), FA’s revised FI projections show that 18/25 counties projected to have the highest 2020 FI rates  majority black
o	Reasons: systemic racism
	History of discriminatory policies and practices  black people are more likely to live in poverty, more likely to face unemployment, have less wealth and assets than white people  variables that can lead to FI
	More likely to hold jobs that have been affected by the pandemic  more vulnerable to economic downturn
o	Longstanding economic and health inequalities  African Americans are experiencing worse health outcomes from Covid-19
	More likely to have inconsistent access to healthcare, face discrimination and more likely to have pre-existing chronic health conditions  increase the severity of Covid’s health impact
o	African Americans in particular  more likely to work as nurses, home health aides and licensed practical and vocational nurses (LPN, LVN) and other jobs without the option of working from home  higher risk of contracting Covid
-	SNAP  continued and increased investment needed (could look at district/state funding)
-	Charitable food assistance  food banks experiencing a “perfect storm” with Covid
o	Surges in demand
o	Declines in food donations due to disruptions in the food supply chain
o	Fewer available volunteers

•	Our analysis  includes Asian communities too

Note: check the “Notes” section


2) Feeding America (other doc – April 22, 2020)
-	Workers with service occupations / work in the leisure and hospitality industry  more likely to be FI and at risk of further hardships as many businesses had to close and lay off staff
-	FI people  37 million in 2018
-	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): people with serious underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart and lung disease diabetes) are more likely to experience severe illness due to contracting Covid-19
o	FI individuals  more likely to have poorer health and diet-related conditions like diabetes (check footnotes on the pdf)
-	Panic buying (stock up on toilet paper, hand sanitisers, food staple, cleaning supplies)  low-income individuals cannot afford the things they need for the near future let alone large shopping purchases 

The Economic Impact on Low-Income Households
Workers with service-related jobs at particular risk  link to ethnicity
-	New unemployment claims  search

3) Morales
-	Household food insecurity: “limited or uncertain ability to acquire adequate food for one or more household members” (Morales 2020)
-	USDA: in 2018, 11.1% (= 37.2 million, 11.2 million children) of US households were food insecure at least part of the time (Morales 2020)
-	Individuals from FI households  poorer physical and mental health (Morales 2020)
-	Especially children  lower quality of life and worse academic performance (Morales 2020)
-	“FI has caused at least 160 billion dollars of economic burden in the USA”  some scholars refer to it as “a symptom of a complex and multidimensional social disease” (Morales 2020)

Covid (notes from Morales 2020 for now):
-	FI rates have been improving since the Great Depression of 2008 and has reached a pre-recession level in 2018.
-	However, the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel COVID-19 coronavirus which was identified in December 2019 has worsened the situation.
-	Very few studies on our chosen topic (could find only one peer-reviewed study on racial/ethnic disparities in household FI during Covid – Morales Oct 4, 2020)
-	Our hypothesis

-	Model 2-5*: In their study, they analysed the four causes of food insecurity for different racial/ethnic groups (causes – dependent variables; race – independent variable)
o	Tables 3 and 4
-	Model 6: predicting the level of food security confidence (there were significant racial findings)
o	Table 5

Notes for project:
-	Clustering
o	Morales used GEEs (generalised estimating equations)
o	GEEs are good for analysing clustered data like the HSP data (clustered within 50 states + DC)

-	The findings in Morales study:
o	First of all, Morales focused on just racial/ethnic disparities
o	“during the pandemic, household FI did not significantly differ across racial/ethnic groups, when demographic characteristics, household structures, SES, and health were controlled.”
o	“a possible explanation is that with a noticeable increase of White FI households during COVID-19, the racial/ethnic gap seems less evident. In other words, we found no support for the hypothesis when all households were included in the model.”
o	“however, the hypothesis holds when we examined the four different causes of food insecurity among households self-reported as food insecure during the pandemic. Specifically, as compared to White food-insecure households, Black food- insecure households were more likely to report that they could not afford to buy more food during the pandemic. This finding is unsurprising in light of previous research that the individuals and families from Black communities are often at the risk of suffering food insecurity [3, 22] due to their social and eco- nomic disadvantages, such as lower SES [52, 53], racial dis- crimination [31], and residential segregation [54–56].”
o	“One putative explanation is that as compared to Whites and other racial/ethnic groups, Blacks are the most likely to work in industries that are affected by the pandemic,” 
	For the COVID FI-unemployment graph, can pick a state with high unemployment and racial group % and do a case study  data & visualisation to show racial minorities more likely to work in jobs affected by the pandemic (hospitality and leisure sector)
o	“Asian FI households more afraid to go out to buy food than White FI households”
	Evidence that shows increased hatred and discrimination towards Asian-Americans since the beginning of the pandemic (Chinese flu, kung-flu etc)  way to rationalise anti-Asian xenophobia
o	Hispanic communities  During the coronavirus outbreak, federal, state, and local authorities have become more involved in enforcing immigration restrictions, and those efforts have largely targeted Hispanic communities 
	“many Hispanic families did not feel comfortable to leave their homes to buy food”
o	“In contrast, the burdens of food insecurity among minority households will last longer because they are caused by systemic economic hardship, interpersonal racial discrimination, and structural racism. Consequently, as suggested by our last model, all racial/ethnic minority groups were significantly less confident about their household food security for the next 4 weeks than Whites.”
o	“minorities were more stressed about feeding their families because their struggle with food was not just temporarily triggered by COVID-19; rather, it is “a symptom of a social disease” [16], deeply rooted within our social systems.” 
	Morales “does not account for nutritional outcomes of food insecurity”  SNAP participation (sugar dense foods with low nutritional values)

4) Odoms-Young (impact of structural racism on FI – not focused on Covid - 2019)
-	USDA: food insecurity “is defined as a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food”.
-	According to data monitored by the USDA, over the past 20 years, FI levels fluctuated, however the gap in prevalence of FI between whites and POC has persisted
o	2001-2016  FI rates for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic households were at least x2 that of non-Hispanic white households
o	other studies on American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) report similar results
	Current Population Survey-Food Security Supplement, Jernigan et al. 2017: 25% AI/AN remained FI & 2x as likely to be FI compared to whites
o	Data by Pew Research Center: wealth of white households  x13 the median of black; x10 that of Hispanic households
-	Some evidence suggests that higher risk of FI still remains when these socio-economic determinants are removed
o	Structural racism
o	Definition of racism on paper pg.2 

5) Center for American Progress – The Coronavirus Crisis Is Worsening Racial Inequality (Maxwell -  May 28, 2020, to June 2, 2020)
https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2020/06/10/486095/coronavirus-crisis-worsening-racial-inequality/ 
-	“Since March 13, an alarming 43 percent of white households have “experienced a loss of employment income.” However, even higher numbers of Asian American, Black, and Hispanic or Latino households have lost income—49 percent, 54 percent, and 63 percent, respectively. (see Figure 1)”
-	“Households of color are also much more likely than their white counterparts to expect “a loss of employment income in the next 4 weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.””
o	Expected (in the next four weeks) white  27%
o	Hispanic/latino  50%
o	Black  41%
o	Asian  39%
-	“According to the Census Bureau data, from May 28 to June 2, Black and Hispanic or Latino households were twice as likely as their white counterparts to report that they sometimes or often do not have enough to eat. (see Figure 2)”
o	US Census Bureau “Household Pulse Survey: May 28 – June 2) data - % of households that sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the previous week, by race:
	White  7%
	Hispanic /latino  17%
	Black  22%
	Asian  6%

Data we will use is from: 
“U.S. Census Bureau’s new weekly Household Pulse Survey, which “ask[s] individuals about their experiences in terms of employment status, spending patterns, food security, housing, physical and mental health, access to health care, and educational disruption.””

6) COVID-19 has plunged more people of color into food insecurity – Promad Acharya (Aug 9, 2020)
https://thecounter.org/covid-19-people-of-color-food-insecurity/ 

-	Investigate Midwest
-	2018  20% black households were FI; 16% Hispanic households were FI / 8% white (USDA)
o	Figures have increased
-	Research from Northwestern University 
o	During the pandemic, FI rates have been twice as high among black households compared to the rate among white households
-	Graphics (2) by Pramod Acharya
-	“Several reasons may explain the increase. The surge in the unemployment rate, loss of subsidized meals because schools closed, delays in relief payments and increased food prices could account for the increases, according to the institute’s research paper.”
Too Many Black Americans Are Dying from COVID-19 – Scientific American (Aug 1, 2020)
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/too-many-black-americans-are-dying-from-covid-19/ 
-	A disproportionate number of people of colour have been killed by the virus, and the causes of this consequence has its roots in structural racism 
-	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  sample of 580 hospitalised people (covid positive) – 33% of patients were black in a population sample where just 18% of the people were black
o	White people  “59% of the same population, but only 45% were infected”
-	“Many people of color work in so-called essential industries such as nursing or home health care, grocery stores and mass transit, where they are more likely to come into close contact with people who are sick.”
-	“these jobs are often poorly paid, and a large proportion of such workers lack health or life insurance.”
-	“In addition, many black, Latinx and indigenous communities have high rates of underlying health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, which are known risk factors for severe illness and death from COVID-19  cause is traced back to racism - redlining that have resulted in poor, overcrowded housing and exposed people of color to more severe levels of air pollution—factors that exacerbate all these health problems.” 
-	“The Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, both of which Congress passed in March, did very little to protect the health of essential workers, according to policy experts across the political spectrum, because they focused more on providing economic relief than medical care or benefits.”

7) Tracking the COVID-19 Recession’s Effects on Food, Housing, and Employment Hardships (updated Dec 18, 2020)
https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and 
-	unemployment rate is very high and millions report that they are not getting enough to eat
-	“The impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread, but are particularly prevalent among Black, Latino,[1] Indigenous, and immigrant households.”
o	“These disproportionate impacts reflect harsh, longstanding inequities — often stemming from structural racism — in education, employment, housing, and health care that the current crisis is exacerbating.”
o	We also wanted to explore the impacts the pandemic had on households led by single females as these households have been reported as one of the social groups affected by FI the most, however they haven’t been included in studies focusing on the impacts of Covid
-	Some relief measures have been taken to mitigate the herdships of Covid, however “there are significant gaps”  e.g. “leaving out the poorest households from any increase in SNAP benefits – and implementation challenges that have delayed aid to some households”
o	These measures are also temporary and “have begun to expire”
-	“households with children face especially high hardship rates, which research has shown can have serious effects on children’s long-term health and financial security.”
o	There already are a lot of research done FI in households with children, so we left that out to create a more focused scope??
-	Emerging data:
o	“The Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, launched in April, has provided nearly real-time weekly data on how the unprecedented health and economic crisis is affecting the nation. Data from this and other sources, such as unemployment data from Census’ Current Population Survey and the Department of Labor, show that tens of millions of people are out of work and struggling to afford adequate food and pay the rent. The impacts on children are large (see figures 1, 4, and 5).”
o	“For more on our methodology and data by state, see tables 1-5 at the end of this document.”
