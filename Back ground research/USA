In 2019 more than 35 million people struggled with hunger.
COVID-19 could lead to more than 54 million people experiencing food insecurity in 2020, out of which 18 million are children. 
Asking: who goes hungry? They divide the issue into different categories: child hunger, senior hunger, rural hunger (“Rural communities make up 63% of counties in the United States and 87% of counties with the highest rates of overall food insecurity”), 
African American hunger (poverty rates for African Americans are more than double than for white Americans) and Latino hunger.

Measuring hunger – can be difficult to quantify the ‘feeling’ of hunger so ‘food insecurity’ is used to measure the conditions that can lead to hunger.
“Food insecurity describes a household’s inability to provide enough food for every person to live an active, healthy life.” – is this not subjective?
Many households suffering from food insecurity don’t qualify for federal nutrition programs, 
relying on other hunger relief organizations or local food banks for support – COULD THIS BE IMPROVED?

Intersection of hunger and health (we could link this to COVID-19)
Intersection of hunger and child development (could also mention the lack of social mobility – suffering from hunger is usually multigenerational).
Food insecurity can be especially harmful for children due to its long term consequences.

Has very good data visualizations + describes 3 stories, showing the diversity of hunger.

Good source of data

We should look at Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which hopes to end poverty by 2030.
We could look at the indicators they use/what they chose to focus on.

The link between undernutrition and obesity (also known as ‘hidden hunger’) as children consume calorie dense foods that are nutritionally poor.
Micronutrient deficiency is rarely discussed in the US, which is ironic as there’s a high awareness of malnutrition in the developing world – 
shows the misleading divide in academics between the “developed” and “developing” countries. 
It disproportionately affects people from low and middle income households – limited access to/cant afford the essential nutrition
“About 85% of Americans do not consume the US Food and Drug Administration’s recommended daily intakes of the most important vitamins and minerals necessary for proper physical and mental development”.
Undernutrition has detrimental economic effects on the US healthcare – 
vitamin deficiencies cost billions for the healthcare system, loss in productivity + wages for those who are sick.

Mississippi is the state with the highest rate of food insecurity in the US.

Regional overview of food security and nutrition in Africa. 
I put it in the US folder because one of the tables shows the levels of food insecurity in different regions in Africa; 
the level of food insecurity in Northern Africa is similar to that of Mississippi – could be useful to mention.
