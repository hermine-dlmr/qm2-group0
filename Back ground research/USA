In 2019 more than 35 million people struggled with hunger.
COVID-19 could lead to more than 54 million people experiencing food insecurity in 2020, out of which 18 million are children.

African American hunger (poverty rates for African Americans are more than double than for white Americans) and Latino hunger.
