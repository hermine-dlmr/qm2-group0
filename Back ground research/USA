In 2019 more than 35 million people struggled with hunger.
COVID-19 could lead to more than 54 million people experiencing food insecurity in 2020, out of which 18 million are children. 
Asking: who goes hungry? They divide the issue into different categories: child hunger, senior hunger, rural hunger (“Rural communities make up 63% of counties in the United States and 87% of counties with the highest rates of overall food insecurity”), 
African American hunger (poverty rates for African Americans are more than double than for white Americans) and Latino hunger.

Measuring hunger – can be difficult to quantify the ‘feeling’ of hunger so ‘food insecurity’ is used to measure the conditions that can lead to hunger.
“Food insecurity describes a household’s inability to provide enough food for every person to live an active, healthy life.” – is this not subjective?
Many households suffering from food insecurity don’t qualify for federal nutrition programs, 
relying on other hunger relief organizations or local food banks for support – COULD THIS BE IMPROVED?

Intersection of hunger and health (we could link this to COVID-19)
Intersection of hunger and child development (could also mention the lack of social mobility – suffering from hunger is usually multigenerational).
Food insecurity can be especially harmful for children due to its long term consequences.

We could look at the indicators they use/what they chose to focus on.
