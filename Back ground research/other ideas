Hidden hunger
 
Hidden hunger is a lack of vitamins and minerals.
Hidden hunger occurs when the quality of food people eat does not meet their nutrient requirements, so the food is deficient in micronutrients such as the vitamins and minerals that they need for their growth and development.
2 billion people suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
Women and children in families with low-income often don’t get enough vitamin a, iodine and iron, and sometimes other essential nutrients. this limits their growth, development, health and working capacity.
Ensuring people get vitamins, minerals and essential nutrients will helps prevent malnutrition.

Chronic Hunger
 
Chronic hunger is the result of inadequate food intake over a long period.
Chronic hunger—when people do not consistently eat enough food to meet their requirements so they don’t get enough dietary energy—is the situation for more than 800 million people in the world today.
One in every nine people goes hungry, every day.
Too many people around the world still die from lack of food. Under-nutrition contributes to almost half of all child deaths. Stunting—an indicator of chronic undernutrition—seriously affects growth and development, and its effects are irreversible.
Ending child under-nutrition would prevent 45% of all child deaths.

Global food loss and waste by region (Our World In Data) (cvs & visualisation) - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-food-waste-by-region
 
Doesn’t show the relative food waste within the country 
Obviously the % of the US is going to be higher because it has a higher population
We can find the values of food wasted (by tonnes annually?) per country and proportion it to that country’s population → “food waste density” (food approximately wasted per person/household)
 
 
Food loss post-harvest by region (Our World In Data) (cvs & visualisation - the original source is on the website) - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-loss-postharvest-by-region
 
Find different kinds of food waste in sub-saharan countries & the US and show where post-harvest food waste falls (magnitude/importance-wise)

Show under/malnourishment by region in the world
Hunger is most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa:
“This increase in hunger levels are largely a result of increases in Sub-Saharan Africa (where rates have risen by several percentage points in recent years) and small increases in the Middle East & North Africa. The UN FAO have linked this increase in undernourishment in particular to the rising extent of conflict-affected countries (which is often a leading cause of famine), and compounded by climate-related factors such as the El Niño phenomenon (which can inflict both drought and flood conditions).1,2”
 
(If we want to focus on children:
There are three key physiological measures of undernourishment and undernutrition in children. The measures discussed and visualised in the sub-sections below are:
Stunting – being ‘too short for one’s age’;
Wasting – being ‘dangerously thin for one’s height’; and
Underweight – low weight-for-age in children.)
