Provisional Project Title: Hungry up! The US is coming!
Team members: Ella Westlake, Camilla Frank, Zeynep Baykam, Joséphine Gardette, Hermine Delamaire

As a group, we have decided to discuss the topic of 'Hidden Hunger' in the US. 

---- Context and motivation ----
Through some research we have done, despite the strong correlation between obesity and undernutrition, we have noticed micronutrient deficiency is not discussed exhaustively. The high obesity rate and US being a developed country both contribute to this issue of nutrient deficiency also known as "hidden hunger" being overlooked. Despite the lack of awareness around this issue, hidden hunger levels have even increased since the beginning of the pandemic, which makes this topic even more intriguing to address and analyse. Our motivation is to expose this 'hidden hunger' in the US, raise awareness and explore how and why minorities are disproportionately affected by it. Our analysis aims to educate people and to provide general information on ‘Hidden Hunger’ and the role it plays in the increase of inequalities in the US. 


---- Suggest available datasets and/or sources of data ----
The main sources of data to support our analysis will be from Dataworld, Feeding America, Our World in Data and USDA given that these databses provide us with the relevant data we need for our invetigation. 


---- Sketch methods for analysing and presenting data ----
We will use different data visualisations according to the analysis we are making.
Our analysis will contain scatter plots to show the evolution of hunger in the US over time.
We will use graphs to visualise the correlation between undernutrition and obesity.
We will create geographic maps with different indicators to show the level of hunger, using both food insecurity and malnutrition levels as parameters. We will internally analyse hunger spread in the US by comparing states. The aim is to build a US map showing "hunger degrees" in each state. Moreover, we will study internal state inequalities, revealing ethnic disparities relating to hunger.
We will also use a bar chart to identify the main causes of hunger is the US (socio-economic causes, and current pandemic crises). 
Our analysis will include a case study on the state with the highest level of food insecurity, which is ‘Mississipi’. 


---- Outline what a successful project will tell you about your domain of interest ----
Provided our analysis is conducted sucessfully, we will understand how COVID-19 has affected ethnic minorities in relation to hunger. 
Additionally, we will make sense of the role of federal nutrition programs. 
Ultimately, we will have sufficient knowledge to suggest targeted policies, helping marginalised groups and raising awareness towards 'hidden hunger' in the US.
