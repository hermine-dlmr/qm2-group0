As a group, we have decided to discuss the topic of 'Hidden Hunger' in the US. 

---- Context and motivation ----
Through some background research we have done, we have noticed that the issue of undernutrition in the US has not been discussed exhaustively. 
We have distinguished, as well, the strong correlation between obesity and undernutrition. Thus, there is a considerable need to adress this issue, especially against the backdrop of COVID-19. 
In addition to the high obesity rate, the US are recognised as a fully developed country, making hunger an overlooked topic. We can therefore talk of a 'hidden hunger' in the US. The lack of awareness in this issue makes it an even more interesting topic, allowing us to bring a real coontribution to its aknowledgement.
Overall, our motivation is to expose this 'Hidden Hunger' in the US, to raise awareness about this worlwide concern and to explore how and why minorities in the US are disproportionately affected by hunger.
Therefore, our analysis aims to educate people and to provide general information on ‘Hidden Hunger’ and the role it plays in the increase of inequalities in the US. 


---- Suggest available datasets and/or sources of data ----
The main sources of data to support our analysis will be Dataworld, Feeding America, Our World in Data and USDA given the wide range of different data it provides. 


---- Sketch methods for analysing and presenting data ----
We will use different data visualisations in order to provide the most relevant visualisation for each type of data. 
Thus, our analysis will contain scatter plots to analyse the evolution of hunger over time.
We will also use graphs to show the correlation between undernutrition and obesity.
We will create geographic maps using different indicators for the situation of hunger, using both food insecurity and malnutrition as parameters. We will internally analyse hunger spread in the US by comparing states. The aim is to build a US map showing "hunger degrees" in each state. Moreover, we will study internal state inequalities, revealing ethnic disparities regarding hunger.
We will also use a bar chart to identify the main causes of hunger is the US (socio-economic causes, and current pandemic crises). 
Our analysis will include a case study on the state with the highest level of food insecurity, which is ‘Mississipi’. 


---- Outline what a successful project will tell you about your domain of interest ----
Provided our analysis is conducted sucessfully, we will understand how COVID-19 has affected ethnic minorities in relation to hunger. 
Additionally, we will make sense of the role of federal nutrition programs. 
Ultimately, we will have sufficient knowledge to suggest targeted policies, helping marginalised groups and raising awareness towards 'hidden hunger' in the US.
