As a group, we have decided to discuss the topic of 'Hidden Hunger' in the US. 

---- Context and motivation ----
Through some background research we have done, we have noticed that the issue of undernutrition in the US has not been discussed exhaustively. 
We have distinguished, as well, the strong correlation between obesity and undernutrition. Thus, there is a considerable need to adress this issue and the background of covid has made it crucial to tackle.
Overall, our motivation is to expose 'Hidden Hunger' in the US, to raise awareness about this worlwide concern, to explore how and why minorities in the US are disproportionately affected by hunger.
Therefore, our analysis aims to educate people and to provide general information on ‘Hidden Hunger’ and the role it plays in the increase of inequalities in the US. 


---- Suggest available datasets and/or sources of data ----
The main sources of data to support our analysis will be Dataworld, Feeding America and Our World in data given the wide range of different data it provides. 


---- Sketch methods for analysing and presenting data ----
We have decided to use different data visualisations in order to provide the most relevant visualisation for each type of data. 
Thus, our analysis will contain scatter plots to analyse the evolution of Hunger over time. 
Maps will be created, as well, using different indicators for the situation of 'hunger' to draw a comparison between states within the US. 
Other maps will be created to highlight the inequalities in the level of Hunger in the US within a state
Our analysis will include a case study on the state with the highest level of food insecurity, which is ‘Mississipi’. 
A bar chart might be used as well to identify the main causes of hunger is the US (socio-economic causes). 



---- Outline what a successful project will tell you about your domain of interest ----
If our analysis is conducted sucessfully, we should be able to understand how covid has affected ethnic minorities in relation to hunger and the role federal nutrition program plays in all of this. 
We should also have sufficient knowledge to find more targeted policies to help these marginalised groups.
