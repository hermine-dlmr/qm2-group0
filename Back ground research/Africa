HUNGER AND FOOD SCARCENESS IN AFRICA HAS MANY CAUSES

The reasons for the widespread hunger and food scarceness in Africa are complex and are not, as often assumed, a lack of agricultural productivity or 
difficult climatic conditions. Sub-Saharan Africa has millions of hectares of fertile soil. The African continent could feed itself.
However, several factors prevent self-sufficiency and a victory in the fight against hunger in Africa:
• Population growth: In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people is growing rapidly, but food production is not keeping up.
• Unfair trading structures: EU and US subsidize domestic agriculture, African farmers are not competitive with cheap food imports.
• Debt trap and mismanagement: The high level of indebtedness of many African countries as well as poor governance and corruption is blocking economic development. Mass poverty and hunger are the consequences.
• Diseases: The AIDS epidemic, as well as dieseases like malaria, inhibits agricultural production in Africa and takes breadwinners from their families.
• Armed conflicts: Africa has more than its share of trouble spots. Most wars in the world rage south of the Sahara. Refugee misery and hunger are the companions.
