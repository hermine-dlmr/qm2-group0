This bubble chart compares rates of unemployment and food insecurity in April 2020 for all 50 states in the US. 
Additionally, the sizes of the bubbles show the number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people.

​

In Part 2, we have identified the role of unemployment and race on food insecurity in the context of COVID-19. 
However, that is not to say that the situation is the same in all states. 
To dive deeper into the COVID-19 impact on food insecurity, we have done some case studies analysing three states.

​

New Jersey

Food insecurity: 25.3%

Unemployment: 15.3%

COVID-19 cases: 44,416

 

From 7.7% in 2019 to 25.3% in 2020, New Jersey has had the greatest increase in food insecurity out of all 50 states (228.6% increase). 
It reported the second highest number of COVID-19 cases in April 2020, as well as an unemployment rate (15.3%) almost twice as high as the national average. 
This devastating increase in food insecurity can be attributed to the New Jersey’s economy’s heavy reliance on the hospitality and leisure industries (Hurdle, 2020). 
Atlantic Country in particular has suffered increases in food insecurity due to its economic reliance on casinos, hotels and Shore-based businesses (The Community Food Bank of New Jersey, 2020). 
Ethnic minorities have been especially affected by the 6-month closures and partial reopenings of businesses, since the majority of service workers in the US are African-American or Hispanic. 
In fact, the third highest Hispanic unemployment in the US with 23.3.%, and the third highest increase in Hispanic unemployment in the first quarter of 2020 was seen in New Jersey (Williams, 2020). 
New Jersey also lagged below the national average for SNAP participation, which contributed to its high food insecurity rate.

​

Nevada

Food insecurity: 22.9%

Unemployment: 28.2%

COVID-19 cases: 2087

 

Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in April 2020, however not the highest food insecurity rate or COVID-19 cases. 
The high unemployment in Nevada is unsurprising as its economy has a strong emphasis on the service industry and tourism (Stein, 2020). 
This has put a bigger burden on Nevada as 25.8% of its labour force works in the leisure and hospitality industries, which were deemed unessential and shut down in March 2020 (Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). 
This contributed to Hispanic unemployment peaking at 30.1% as the highest rate in the US in April 2020 (Williams, 2020). 
Nonetheless, numerous food aid programmes and waivers were implemented in Nevada such as the Nevada Women, Infants and Children Programme (WIC), which serves “income-eligible pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants and children up to age five (5) years who are at nutrition risk” (Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). 
Moreover, Nevada has two food banks instead of one (FBNN and Three Square), both of which are members of Feeding America’s national network  (Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). 
These factors help explain the unexpectedly lower food insecurity levels in Nevada, given that it had the highest unemployment rate.

​

Hawaii

Food insecurity: 19.5%

Unemployment: 22.3%

COVID-19 cases: 362

 

Despite having a relatively low number of COVID-19 cases, Hawaii has been hit hard by the current pandemic, as there has been a severe decline in tourism (Mosley and McMahon, 2020). 
With such a big hit to the state’s top industry, one-third of its working population became unemployed in April 2020 (Mosley and McMahon, 2020). 
Due to the high unemployment, more people have been relying on help from food banks, however this has left food banks overwhelmed with need. 
The COVID-19 crisis has only made matters worse as it exacerbated this problem with a disruption in the food chain in Hawaii - 85% to 90% of which is imported (Office Of Planning Department Of Business Economic Development & Tourism, 2012). 
Hunger relief organisations usually rely on food with long shelf-life, however, with such a huge disruption to the food supply chain caused by COVID-19 and people stocking up, food banks had to start relying on local farmers to provide what they could not get. 
However, this solution also comes with its limitations as only 6% of farmers in Hawaii have the financial means to double the food production to supply food banks (Jung, 2020).
