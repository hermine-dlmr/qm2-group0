This timeline graph shows how food insecurity in the US has evolved over the past 22 years. 
The first jump in the rate of food insecurity happened going into 2008 due to the Great Recession and reached the highest rate in 2009 before it started to decline. 
After 2009, there was a steady decline in levels of food insecurity over the past decade. 
Eventually, the rates not only reached pre-recession levels, but also an all-time low in over 20 years in 2019.

 

However, the improvements made to combat food insecurity over the past decade have been undermined by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. 
In only a few months between the end of 2019 and April 2020, food insecurity rates went from 10.9% to 23.5% - a sharp 115.6% increase.

 

Moreover, the highest rate of food insecurity used to be 16.6%, which was recorded in 2009 during the Great Recession. 
However, the April 2020 rate (23.5%) is 1.4 times higher than 16.6%, which suggests that the economic crisis caused by the current pandemic has created an even more serious and pressing issue of food insecurity in the US. 
Since the spring of 2020, in addition to the 35 million people who are already struggling with food insecurity, millions of people are newly experiencing it.
