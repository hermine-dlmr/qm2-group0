This graph shows the evolution of unemployment in the US between the years 2000 and 2020. 
It also illustrates how the COVID-19 restrictions and their consequences on the economy have affected rates of unemployment in the US.

 

Before the spring of 2020, levels of unemployment had been the lowest by 3.5% (December 2019) in the last 20 years. 
However, these improvements, especially the steady decline in unemployment since the Great Recession, were reversed when the novel COVID-19 coronavirus was identified in December 2019. 

 

An economic recession began in April 2020 due to the ongoing pandemic and its lockdown restrictions, which can be identified from the graph as there was a sharp increase (234% increase) in unemployment in the same month. 
In April 2020, unemployment rates reached the highest percentage in the past 20 years, 14.7%, which is also more than triple the rate of 4.4.% of the previous month (March 2020). 
Moreover, compared to the rates during the Great Recession (December 2007 - June 2009), 14.7% is almost 1.5 times higher than the highest rate reached around that period (and ever since the year 2000 before 2020), which was 10.0% in October 2009.

However, it is important to mention that this sudden surge in unemployment did not affect the socially diverse population of the United States in a uniform way. The bar chart below illustrates these disparities.
