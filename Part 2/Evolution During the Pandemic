As seen by Graph 3.2 (unemployment timeline, 2000-2020), the rates of unemployment have been declining since April 2020. 
However, as Graph 3.4 (food insecurity timeline, April 23 - December 7, 2000) shows, by contrast, the level of food insecurity has been increasing since April 2020. 
A reason for this inconsistency could be explained by long standing systemic racial inequalities. 

 

This suggestion is supported by our data and Graph 3.3 (bar chart on unemployment rate by ethnicity). 
In the last quarter of 2020, while national unemployment rates were declining, the level of unemployment among White Americans (7.9%) was significantly lower than those among other ethnic minorities (African American/Black - 13.2%, Hispani/Latino - 11.2 %, Asian - 10.6%). 

 

Due to interpersonal racial discrimination, systemic economic hardships and structural racism (in employment, education, health care etc.) in the US, the burdens of the new high levels of food insecurity will last longer among racial/ethnic minorities despite the decline in national unemployment rates (Tracking the COVID-19 Recession’s Effects on Food, Housing, and Employment Hardships, 2021). 
Although it may seem like the world has started to recover from or adapt to the COVID-19 crisis, minority groups have been disproportionately affected because of reasons listed above which the current pandemic is exacerbating.
