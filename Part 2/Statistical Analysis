The timeline graphs for food insecurity and unemployment over the past two decades (Graphs 3.1 and 3.2) both follow a very similar trend - as it can be seen by the lines, rates for both increase and decrease at relatively similar times. 
This strong correlation between food insecurity rates and unemployment rates between 2000 and 2020 is supported by the high r-value (0.95). 
Moreover, this correlation is statistically significant and did not occur by chance which is reflected by the very small p-value (1.8*10^-11 << 0.05). 

 

These statistical findings consolidate the idea that unemployment is one of the main determinants of food insecurity, hence it significantly affects the levels of food insecurity.

 

However, it is important to mention that correlation does not automatically equal causality. 
This statistical analysis cannot determine whether or not unemployment single-handedly causes food insecurity or vice versa. 
In fact, after April 2020, food insecurity and unemployment rates stop following the same correlated pattern.
